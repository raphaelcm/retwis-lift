Retwis-Lift is a re-implementation of Retwis by @antirez.

The original Retwis was written in PHP.  Retwis-lift is written in Scala using the Lift framework.

Technologies used
-----
Database: Redis (http://redis.io)
Database driver: Jedis (http://github.com/xetorthio/jedis)
Web framework: Lift (http://liftweb.net)
Language: Scala (http://www.scala-lang.org/)

Getting started
-----
1. Clone the repository
2. At the repository root, type './sbt'
3. Type 'update'
4. Type 'jetty-run'
5. Open a browser and go to http://localhost:8080


This is my first ever Lift app, first Scala project, and my first time using Redis.  I'm sure there are design patterns and conventions I misused or didn't use.  Please send me feedback, suggestions, or just improve the code and send it to me!

Thanks,
